# R
Olala~~At first, I'm a student, not a programmer yet. My research orientation is data visualization, so I decided to get start with R. I found out a book named Web Analysis and Mining With R in our school library. However, I failed to get access to source codes with the authour's blog presented in the introduction. Thus, I decided to verify the codes in this book with my hands.
